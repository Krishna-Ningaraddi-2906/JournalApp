I have removed this file as i am using environment variables for dev and CLI for prod

we need to use spring.profiles.active=dev in environment variables

in production we run the jar file using "java -jar JournalApp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"

as we have written the tests to create the jar we need to use ".\mvn clean package -D spring.profiles.active=dev"

Command	What it does
"mvn clean package" -->	Builds app, runs tests using default profile
"mvn clean package -D spring.profiles.active=dev" -->	Builds app, runs tests using dev profile
"mvn clean package -D skipTests" -->	Builds app without running any tests

"java -jar JournalApp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod" --> we use this command to run the jar file
with prod profile

# yml file
# Profiling Enabled
# This is a default file

spring:
  profiles:
    active: prod  # dev, prod what we use that will be the active profile

application.properties type file

# spring.application.name=JournalApp
# spring.data.mongodb.uri= mongodb+srv://ningaraddi27krishna:AqCv%408587@cluster0.6sijp35.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
# Here Password AqCv@8587 is encoded as AqCv%408587 where  @ as %40 :as%3A / as 2F
# spring.data.mongodb.auto-index-creation=true
# spring.data.mongodb.database=JournalApp

# here by default the index will not be created so we need to mention the below line so that springboot does the job


# Below 2 lines are commented as we are now connecting our db to mongodb atlast i.e. cloud
# spring.data.mongodb.host=localhost
# spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
# Here we haven't gave any authentication to the db so UN and PWD is not required if given below mentioned lines to be used
# spring.data.mongodb.username=xyz
# spring.data.mongodb.password=abc
